            IWC Wellness and Preventive Consultancy Inc ., was established in
            2016 with a commitment to provide and deliver the best oral care
            every Filipino deserves. It was created to provide a link to various
            dental professionals and an easy access to affordable dental health
            plans fit for everyoneâ€™s unique needs.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg mb-12">
            The company is managed by a group of dedicated professionals and
            powered by an upright system that makes the link between its members
            and partners fast and easy, making every client-dentist transaction
            exceptionally convenient.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg mb-12">
            The idea of having someone handle the marketing aspects of dental
            services was taking off in the dental industry. Dentists wanted to
            focus on patients and not on everyday aspects of promoting their
            business. IWC Wellness took it as a cue and since then, has
            partnered with various dental professionals all over the country to
            establish a national dental network.
